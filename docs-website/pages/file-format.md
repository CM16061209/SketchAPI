Sketch documents use ZIP archives containing JSON encoded data.

Your app can unzip it, modify some of the files and zip it back. You don't even need Sketch at all! You can even create a Sketch file from scratch. The [`sketch-file`](https://github.com/mathieudutour/sketch-file) library might help with that.

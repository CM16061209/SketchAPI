Sketch plugins are listed in a GitHub repository. This document explains how to publish it there and how to allow Sketch to receive updates for your plugin.

## Publishing for the first time

Sketch plugins are listed in a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/sketchplugins/plugin-directory](https://github.com/sketchplugins/plugin-directory).

To add your plugin to the list, open a PR with the information about your plugin. Once it is merged, your plugin will appear here: [https://sketch.com/extensions/plugins/](https://sketch.com/extensions/plugins/) after the site is deployed (this can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the schedule of our web team).

If you use `skpm`, the first time you publish a plugin using `skpm publish`, it will automatically create the PR for you.

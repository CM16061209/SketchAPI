<hr style="height: 1px;
           border: 0;
           background: white;
           background-image: linear-gradient(
             to right,
             rgba(0,0,0,0),
             rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 10%,
             rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 90%,

## Getting started

### Run a script

Try the Sketch JavaScript API now, directly within Sketch. The code below shows a message at the bottom of your Sketch Document window saying _Hello Sketch ðŸ‘‹_.

<img src="/images/developer/menu-run-script.png"
     alt="Run script menu"
     width="235"
     style="max-width: 100%;" />

1. Open a new or existing file in Sketch
1. Select _Run Scriptâ€¦_ from the _Plugins_ menu or use the keyboard shortcut `control + shift + k` to bring up the code editor
1. Paste in the code below
1. Select _Run_

```javascript
const sketch = require('sketch')

sketch.UI.message('Hello Sketch ðŸ‘‹')
```

### Publish a plugin

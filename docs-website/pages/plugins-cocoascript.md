[CocoaScript](https://github.com/ccgus/CocoaScript) is a bridge providing access to the internal Sketch APIs and macOS frameworks in JavaScript.

From CocoaScriptâ€™s `README`:

> CocoaScript is built on top of Appleâ€™s JavaScriptCore, the same JavaScript engine that powers Safari. So when you write in CocoaScript, you are really writing JavaScript.
>
> CocoaScript also includes a bridge which lets you access Appleâ€™s Cocoa frameworks from JavaScript. This means you have a ton wonderful classes and functions you can use in addition to the standard JavaScript library.

## Syntax

The square bracket syntax of Objective-C is converted to dot-syntax in JavaScript. Internally CocoaScript creates opaque JavaScript proxy objects which have the following attributes.

- Objective-C properties are also JavaScript properties.
- Objective-C selectors are exposed as methods of the JavaScript proxy.
- `:` are converted to `_`, the last underscore is optional.
- Each component of the selector is concatenated into a single string with no separation.

### Objective-C

```obj-c
[executeOperation:withObject:error:]
```

### JavaScript

```js
executeOperation_withObject_error()
```

## Pointer

Some Objective-C selectors require pointer parameters. Since JavaScript does not support passing objects by reference CocoaScript provides `MOPointer`, a proxy object to create references from variables.

```js
let str = NSMutableString.alloc().init()
let pointer = MOPointer.alloc().initWithValue(str)

str.setString('Hello Sketch')
console.log(pointer.value())

str.appendString(' ðŸ‘‹')
console.log(pointer.value())
```

## Use macOS Frameworks
